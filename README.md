PYTHON CODE TO CREATE RANDOM DEFECTS ON A STEEL PLATE IN BLENDER 2.8 USING PIL AND OPENCV TO MANAGE IMAGES

The paths need to be changed to paths to your python packages

The file structure used whilst writing this add-on was:

 steel-blender 
 ├── brushes ~~ at this level is the image for scale-only
 │   ├── in
 │   └── out
 └── defects ~~ this folder is where we saved the images with the defects
